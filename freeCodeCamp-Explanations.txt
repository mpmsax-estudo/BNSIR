    background: var(--penguin-skin, gray);
	...
}

.penguin-bottom {
  	...
    background: var(--penguin-skin, gray);
  	...
}

Inherit CSS Variables
	:root is a pseudo-class selector that matches the root element of the document, usually the html element. By creating your variables in :root, they will be available globally and can be accessed from any other selector in the style sheet.
